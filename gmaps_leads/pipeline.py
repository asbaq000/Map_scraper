"""The run engine: turn a request for leads into rows in a spreadsheet.

One place holds the whole sequence — geocode, scrape, recover phones, hunt
emails, write CSV, push to Sheets — so the command line and the web UI behave
identically. Callers get progress through an `emit` callback and can stop a run
through a `should_stop` callback; neither needs to know anything about
browsers, tiles, or worksheets.

A request can name several client types and several cities. That becomes one
task per (client type, city) pair, run in order, each one landing on its own
tab in the spreadsheet.
