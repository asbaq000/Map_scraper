"""Local SQLite store: cross-run dedupe, resume, and CSV export.

The database is what makes a 1,000-lead run survivable. Scraping that many
listings takes hours and Google will interrupt you. Every lead is persisted the
moment it is found, so a killed run resumes instead of starting over, and
re-running next week adds only genuinely new businesses.

Dedupe happens twice over. `place_id` is the primary key, which catches the
same listing surfacing under several search phrasings or neighbouring tiles.
`dkey` (see models.dedupe_key) catches the same business listed twice under
different place ids, which Google does after a shop moves or re-registers.
